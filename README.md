# Dinero Expense Tracker

Welcome to our newest group project, the Dinero Expense Tracker! This repository includes a list of technologies used to create the app, reasons for our technology choices, how to use the application, and details on any bugs or missing functionality.

## What Was Our Motivation?

We were tasked with creating a full-stack application similar to our last group project, but this time including user authentication, such as secure logins and passwords. Among the list of provided applications, an expense tracker stood out as a compelling choice.

## How to Use the Application

Upon entering the website, users will be prompted to either sign up or log in. After completing the signup or login process, users will be greeted by the Dashboard, where they can log transactions, input income amount, and view a list of expenses/transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Sequelize, bcrypt
- **Frontend**: React
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Deployment**: AWS

## Fixes/Features for the Future

As this application is a work in progress, we have several features planned for future implementation. One of the key enhancements will be ensuring that transactions are properly deducted from the total income. This section of the README will be updated regularly to reflect major changes and new developments!
