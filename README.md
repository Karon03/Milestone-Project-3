# Dinero Expense Tracker

Welcome to our newest group project, the Dinero Expense Tracker! This repository includes a list of technologies used to create the app, reasons for our technology choices, how to use the application, and details on any bugs or missing functionality.

## What Was Our Motivation?

We were tasked with creating a full-stack application similar to our last group project, but this time including user authentication, such as secure logins and passwords. Among the list of provided applications, an expense tracker stood out as a compelling choice.

## How to Use the Application

Upon entering the website, users will be prompted to either sign up or log in. After completing the signup or login process, users will be greeted by the Dashboard, where they can log transactions, input income amounts, and view a list of expenses/transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Sequelize, bcrypt
- **Frontend**: React
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Deployment**: AWS

## Fixes/Features for the Future

As this application is still a work in progress, there are several outstanding issues that need to be addressed. We are currently working on styling all the pages properly. The signup page needs a redirect or a button to return to the home page or login. Additionally, the Dashboard page is still under development, and  need to ensure that the current features work and begin to add more to it. This secion of the README will be updated frequently as we go through major changes!
